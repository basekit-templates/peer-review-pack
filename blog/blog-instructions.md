1.) Follow instructions in file 'peer-review-pack/blog/post-1.txt' to create the first post 

2.) Create another 2 blog posts. This time very simple ones, only fill in the name and 
content with some short text. This is to test a design of post without any extra features 
and to be able to see a pagination.

3.) Create another 3 simple blog posts. This time with Feature images, use 
'blog-tall-feature-image.jpg',
'blog-square.jpg',
'blog-huge-image.jpg'.

This is to test how different image sizes are handled in the template.
